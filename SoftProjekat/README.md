# Soft Computing - E2 (2018) - Level 2


Task solution for Soft Computing course.

Task was to analyze video and detect sum of digits which crossed the line in it.

Line is detected by applying probabilistic Hough transformation, and digit recognition is done by convolutional neural network trained on MNIST data set.

Solution is compatible only with Python 3.6, because of compatibility issues of used libraries.


Solution is run by following command:
`python run.py`


In order to evaluate calculated results to actual results run following command:
`python test.py`
